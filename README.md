Enhancing Privacy Rights and Consumer Protection Through AI-Driven Consent Management in Digital Services 

## Summary
This project aims to develop an AI-based framework to empower online consumers to make informed decisions about their data privacy. By leveraging AI to interpret complex privacy policies, the system would flag risks and help users customize their consent preferences. The project will involve fine-tuning a machine learning model (or using a suitable existing one) for privacy policy interpretation, building a prototype consent tool, and assessing its effectiveness.
